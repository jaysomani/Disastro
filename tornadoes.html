                    <p><b>To stay safe during a tornado, prepare a plan and an emergency kit, stay aware of weather conditions during thunderstorms, know the best places to shelter both indoors and outdoors, and always protect yourself from injury, especially
                        your head.<br></b> Tornadoes continue to impact locations across the country every year, bringing massive winds and destruction of properties in their paths.<br> The 2021 tornado season claimed the lives of 103 individuals, injured
                        hundreds more, and caused billions of dollars in damage. The deadliest outbreak occurred in December. While the likelihood of a tornado occurring on a December day in the United States is 12%–15% (compared to 90% in early June),
                        December tornadoes have the ability to cause significant damage. <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>TIP 1️⃣: Be prepared.</b><br> The best way to stay safe during a tornado is to be prepared with the following items: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fresh batteries and a battery-operated TV, radio, or internet-enabled device to listen to the latest emergency weather information</li><br>
                            <li>A tornado emergency plan including access to a safe shelter for yourself, your family, people with special needs, and your pets</li><br>
                            <li>An emergency kit (including water, non-perishable food, and medication)</li><br>
                            <li>A list of important information, including telephone numbers</li><br>
                        </ul><br> Be sure your children know what a tornado is, what tornado watches and warnings are, what county or parish they live in (warnings are typically issued by county or parish), and what makes a location a safe shelter, whether
                        at home or at school. <br>
                        <b>TIP 2️⃣: Stay aware of weather conditions.</b><br> To protect yourself and your loved ones from harm during a tornado, pay close attention to changing weather conditions in your area. If you know thunderstorms are expected,
                        stay tuned to local radio and TV stations or a NOAA weather radio station for further weather information. Some tornadoes strike rapidly without time for a tornado warning. The following weather signs may mean that a tornado is
                        approaching: <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A dark or green-colored sky</li><br>
                            <li>A large, dark, low-lying cloud</li><br>
                            <li>Large hail</li><br>
                            <li>A loud roar that sounds like a freight train</li><br>
                        </ul><br>If you notice any of these conditions, take cover immediately, and stay tuned to local radio and TV stations, a NOAA weather radio station, or the internet.<br>
                        <b>TIP 3️⃣: Know where to shelter.</b><br> Falling and flying debris causes most injuries and deaths during a tornado. Although there is no completely safe place during a tornado, some locations are much safer than others. <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to the basement or an inside room without windows on the lowest floor (bathroom, closet, center hallway).</li><br>
                            <li>If possible, avoid sheltering in any room with windows.</li><br>
                            <li>For added protection get under something sturdy (a heavy table or workbench). Cover your body with a blanket, sleeping bag or mattress. Protect your head with anything available.</li><br>
                            <li>Do not stay in a mobile home.</li><br>
                        </ul><br>If you are outside or in a mobile home, find a nearby building, preferably with a basement. If you are in a car, do not try to outrun a tornado, but instead find the nearest sturdy building.<br>

                    <br><b>You can't stop a tropical storm or hurricane, but you can take steps now to protect yourself and your family.You can’t stop a tropical storm or hurricane, but you can take steps now to protect yourself and your family.</b><br>                    If you live in areas at risk, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) encourages you to be prepared for hurricane season. The Atlantic hurricane season is June 1 through November 30 each year. It’s always important to
                    be prepared for a hurricane.<br> Planning for hurricane season and other potential disasters can be stressful, and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it may be especially so. Your planning may be different this
                    year because of the need to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.<br>
                    <h1>Preparing for a Hurricane</h1><br> Follow these important hurricane preparedness tips from CDC:<br> ✔️Prepare for a hurricane: Take basic steps now to ensure your safety should a storm hit. <br> ✔️Get emergency supplies: Stock your
                    home and your car with supplies. Give yourself more time than usual to prepare your emergency food, water, and medicine supplies. Home delivery is the safest choice for buying disaster supplies; however, that may not be an option for
                    everyone. If in-person shopping is your only choice, take steps to protect your and others’ health when running essential errands.<br> ✔️Make a plan: Create a family disaster plan.<br> ✔️Prepare to evacuate: Never ignore an evacuation
                    order. Pay attention to local guidance about updated plans for evacuations and shelters, including shelters for your pets.<br> ✔️Protect older adults: Understand older adult health and medical concerns.<br> ✔️Protect your pets: Ensure
                    your pet’s safety before, during, and after a hurricane. ✔️When you check on neighbors and friends, be sure to follow social distancing recommendations (staying at least 6 feet from others) and other CDC recommendations to protect
                    yourself and others.<br>
                    <p><br>CDC recommends that you print important documents (e.g., emergency phone numbers, insurance information) before a hurricane strikes. Power outages during and after a hurricane can prevent you from accessing information online when
                        you most need it.<br> Preparing now can help keep you and your family safe.<br> If you need to evacuate, take steps to protect yourself and your family from COVID-19. Prepare a “go kit” with personal items you cannot do without
                        during an emergency. Include items that can help protect you and others from COVID-19, such as hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, bar or liquid soap, disinfectant wipes (if available), and multiple, well-fitting masks for
                        each person. Masks should have two or more layers and fit snugly against your face. They should not be used by people having trouble breathing, or who are unconscious, incapacitated, or unable to remove the mask without assistance.

                    </p>
                    <h1>Staying Safe After a Hurricane</h1>
                    <br> In addition to preparing for a hurricane, it’s important to take steps to stay safe after a hurricane is over, for example:<br> ✔️Avoid flooded areas: Take precautions before, during, and after a flood. Never drive through floodwater.<br>                    ✔️Prevent carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning after the storm: Ensure your CO detector has working batteries. Place generators outside at least 20 feet from any door, window, or vent.<br> ✔️Continue to follow preventive actions to protect
                    yourself and others from COVID-19.<br> ✔️Dealing with disasters can cause stress and strong emotions, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is natural to feel anxiety, grief, and worry. Coping with these feelings and getting
                    help when you need it will help you, your family, and your community recover.<br>

                    <br><b>Each year, more deaths occur because of flooding than any other hazard related to thunderstorms. The most common flood deaths occur when a vehicle is driven into hazardous floodwater. Fortunately, during a flood, you can take steps to protect yourself, your family, and your home.</b>
                    <br>
                    <h1>During a Flood Watch or Warning</h1><br> ✔️Gather emergency supplies, including non-perishable food and water. Store at least 1 gallon of water per day for each person and each pet. Store at least a 3-day supply.<br> ✔️Listen to your
                    local radio or television station for updates.<br> ✔️Have immunization records handy (or know the year of your last tetanus shot).<br> •Store immunization records in a waterproof container.<br> ✔️Bring in outdoor items (lawn furniture,
                    grills, trash cans) or tie them down securely.<br> ✔️If evacuation appears necessary, turn off all utilities at the main power switch and close the main gas valve.<br> ✔️Leave areas subject to flooding such as low spots, canyons, washes,
                    etc. (Remember: avoid driving through flooded areas and standing water.)<br>

                    <h1>After Flooding Occurs</h1>
                    <br>
                    <b>✔️Avoid driving through flooded areas and standing water. As little as six inches of water can cause you to lose control of your vehicle.</b><br> ✔️Do not drink flood water, or use it to wash dishes, brush teeth, or wash/prepare
                    food. Drink clean, safe water.<br> ✔️If you evacuated, return to your home only after local authorities have said it is safe to do so.<br> ✔️Listen for boil water advisories. Local authorities will let you know if your water is safe
                    for drinking and bathing.<br> •During a water advisory, use only bottled, boiled, or treated water for drinking, cooking, etc.<br> ✔️When in doubt, throw it out! Throw away any food and bottled water that comes/may have come into contact
                    with floodwater.<br> ✔️Prevent carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Use generators at least 20 feet from any doors, windows, or vents. If you use a pressure washer, be sure to keep the engine outdoors and 20 feet from windows, doors, or
                    vents as well. Never run your car or truck inside a garage that is attached to a house even with the garage door open.<br>
                    <br>
                    <p>The initial damage caused by a flood is not the only risk. Standing floodwater can also spread infectious diseases, bring chemical hazards, and cause injuries.
                        <br> After you return home, if you find that your home was flooded, practice safe cleaning. Remove and throw out drywall and insulation that was contaminated with floodwater or sewage. Throw out items that cannot be washed and
                        cleaned with a bleach solution: mattresses, pillows, carpeting, carpet padding, and stuffed toys. Homeowners may want to temporarily store items outside of the home until insurance claims can be filed<br>

                    <h1>Stay Safe During an Earthquake</h1>
                    <br><b><br>
					<h1>Drop. Cover. Hold on.</h1><br>

					<br>
					In most situations, you can protect yourself if you immediately:<br>
					✔️<b>DROP down onto your hands and knees</b> before the earthquake knocks you down. This position protects you from falling but allows you to still move if necessary.<br> ✔️
                    <b>COVER your head and neck</b> (and your entire body if possible) underneath a sturdy table or desk. If there is no shelter nearby, get down near an interior wall or next to low-lying furniture that won’t fall on you, and cover your
                    head and neck with your arms and hands.<br> ✔️
                    <b>HOLD ON to your shelter </b>(or to your head and neck) until the shaking stops. Be prepared to move with your shelter if the shaking shifts it around.<br>
                    <p><br><b><h3>If you are inside, stay inside.</h3></b><br>
                    </p>
                    <br> DO NOT run outside or to other rooms during an earthquake. You are less likely to be injured if you stay where you are.<br> To reduce your chances of being hurt, take the following actions:<br> ✔️If possible, within the few seconds
                    before shaking intensifies, quickly move away from glass, hanging objects, bookcases, china cabinets, or other large furniture that could fall. Watch for falling objects, such as bricks from fireplaces and chimneys, light fixtures,
                    wall hangings, high shelves, and cabinets with doors that could swing open.<br> ✔️If available nearby, grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and broken glass.<br> ✔️If you are in the kitchen, quickly turn
                    off the stove and take cover at the first sign of shaking.<br> ✔️If you are in bed, hold on and stay there, protecting your head with a pillow. You are less likely to be injured staying where you are. Broken glass on the floor can
                    cause injuries if you walk or roll onto the floor.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>DO NOT stand in a doorway. You are safer under a table.</b> In modern houses, doorways are no stronger than any other part of the house. Doorways do not protect you from the most likely source of injury − falling or flying objects.
                    Most earthquake-related injuries and deaths are caused by falling or flying objects (such as TVs, lamps, glass, or bookcases), or by being knocked to the ground.<br>
                    <h2>If you are in a high-rise building, drop, cover, and hold on.</h2>
                    <br> ✔️Move away from windows and outside walls.<br> .✔️Stay in the building.<br> ✔️DO NOT use the elevators. The electricity may go out, and the sprinkler systems may come on.<br> ✔️If you are trapped, stay calm. Try to get someone’s
                    attention by tapping on hard or metal parts of the structure. Doing so may increase your chances of being rescued.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>If you are inside a crowded place, drop, cover, and hold on.</h3><br> ✔️Do not rush for the doorways. Others will have the same idea.<br> ✔️Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall.<br> ✔️If you can, take cover
                    and grab something to shield your head and face from falling debris and glass.<br>
                    <h3><br>If you are outside, stay outside.</h3>
                    <br> ✔️Move away from buildings, utility wires, sinkholes, and fuel and gas lines. The greatest danger from falling debris is just outside doorways and close to outer walls of buildings.<br> ✔️Go to an open area away from trees, telephone
                    poles, and buildings. Once in the open, get down low and stay there until the shaking stops.<br> ✔️The area near the outside walls of a building is the most dangerous place to be. Windows, facades, and architectural details are often
                    the first parts of the building to collapse. Stay away from this danger zone.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>If you are in a moving vehicle, stop as quickly and safely as possible.</h3><br> ✔️Move your car to the shoulder or curb, away from utility poles, overhead wires, and under- or overpasses.<br> ✔️Stay in the car and set the parking
                    brake. A car may jiggle violently on its springs, but it is a good place to stay until the shaking stops.<br> ✔️Turn on the radio for emergency broadcast information.<br> ✔️If a power line falls on the car, stay inside until a trained
                    person removes the wire.<br> ✔️When it is safe to begin driving again, watch for hazards created by the earthquake, such as breaks in the pavement, downed utility poles and wires, rising water levels, fallen overpasses, or collapsed
                    bridges.
